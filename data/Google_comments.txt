Google , would love to see you guys make this right."
2 """The wait is over."" Um, might want to check yourself on that, Google. Clearly the wait has just begun. Someone had an oopsie planning this rollout, eh?"
3 "Went to website, no crashes. Was being decisive for a while but ended up getting the 256 Pixel 6. Also free ear buds.üëç"
4 "Or, and this might be crazy, how about emailing registered Pixel Fans a link so they can order through a portal that is not backlogged, but that would make too much sense to celebrate loyal owners, right?"
5 "Leave it to Google to screw up their own launch by having their store crash"
6 "Uh... you post this nonsense about how GREAT the new tech and chip are but apparently you forgot to load them into your own website!? Launch day and I'm running into glitches you had to KNOW were coming. Get off it!"

8 "Started the morning super excited but left with nothing but disappointment and error messages. #Pixel6launchfai
lure #pixel6launchü§¨ My Pixel2XL keeps restarting randomly so I need a new phone and none of the other Google phones have been enough of an upgrade for me. Should I get an iPhone13 instead?"
9 "Your phones are great but so big. Please work on smaller size with same amazing picture power and Pixel tools"
10 "Hey G, we need that on-hold feature for google store. Maybe you can let us know when we can finally checkout. P6P in the cart for 1.5+ hours, checkout broken, still."
11 "Does anyone know if Android 12 will fix the wireless charging that was broken on my Pixel4XL by Google when they did a update in March?? I know they were having problems with the batteries on the Pixel 4. I had to replace mine after just a yr.. and now that I'm thinking about it it started having problems right after I bought and started using the pixel stand. Then Google did the update and my wireless charging hasn't worked since. I want my money back for the Pixel stand if I can't use it to wirelessly charge my pixel 4. Was gonna upgrade to the 6 pro but how do I know they same won't happen to the wireless charging on the pixel 6 pro too???"
12 "I felt like Ticketmaster! I was excited, but your store Crashed : Now it appears Bots bought up all the phones, how does a Pre-order Sell Out? The Wait isn't over..."

14 "The wait is over*

* if you live somewhere Google decides to sell their phones.

I don't know if any Pixel has been available in NZ without importing it somehow?"
15 "Love my pixel phone but I think Google will be loosing me as a customer for now. The Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 pro are to big compared to my pixel 3. Perhaps if they make a smaller phone in the future I will consider buying a pixel again."
16 "The store was down more than an hour already üëΩ"
17 "The wait is not over. The wait for your website to work is ongoing. Waiting, waiting and more waiting"
18 "Nice work, Google - selling out to bots like that."
19 "Looks like the wait isn't over site doesn't work. Then later everyone will be selling them on eBay for way much more"
20 "The store died as soon as the live event started, came back 21 minutes later, and now checkout is dead."

24 "Okay, I was going to go to the Verizon retailer by me and pre order a pixel 6 pro but then I remembered that I'm pissed that my Pixel 4XL stopped working with the Google wireless charger stand I bought after Google did an update in March. Is the same thing going to happen to the pixel 6 pro if I buy it. I saw on line that there seem to be 100's of people who pixels 4 all stopped wirelessly stopped charging. If I can't use the google stand anymore because of this update I want my money back"
25 "I've got an error on shipping address page. Anyone?"
26 "Howdy, just got a Pixel 5a 3 weeks ago. Can I return it to get a Pixel 6 series? without the restocking fee? I like the 5a, but feel like it is already obsolete, and would like the 6 instead."
27 "The waiting has apparently just begun since the Google Store shows both the 256 and 512G unlocked models as ""out of stock"" already. Guess I the 4XL could be sticking around for a other year."
28 "Hello, just wondering if the pixel buds will be back in stock soon. I don't want to pre order the pixel 6 pro until Google has addressed how they are getting everyone the buds.
Thanks in advance for the reply"

35 "I don't think I'll get another pixel after an android update broke my phone battery and google won't admit it or do anything about it. It's happened to thousands of people."
36 "Exactly how does pre-order get out of stock I'm so disappointed right now"
37 "Preordered my Pixel 6 Pro from Fi. Pixel 4xl user and I can't wait for these new cameras and the third-party camera integration! I'd love to finish up my degree and work at Google in the future. It seems like a great place with great minds. Pixel phones are really such great tools for everyday use."
38 "This s*** is turning out to be just like the PlayStation 5 where all bots were able to buy all consoles. and not one f****** customer this is b******* if people already have the phone on their cart they should be able to just to pay for it"
39 "Owns a Pixel 5 and not happy with my experience so far. I am with Google for a long time but the only phone I liked the most was my 2 XL. Google owes me a good phone experience so far."
40 "I managed to order one through telstra, walked into their store. Hopefully they didn't sell an out of stock phone to me. üò¥"
41 "I just went on your site to order the pixel 6 pro the minute it went live, I've been a pixel owner since every phone was released, I've been a beta tester for pretty much every release of android, I'm a massive helper on google guides, via my reviews with millions of views... Ive pretty much dedicated my digital life to Google... Hell I've even endured the pixel 5!!!
Yet as a pixel superfan i cannot even manage to get a simple pre-order... The site simply didn't work despite me adding to my basket for over 2 hours and getting the sorry its not you it's us message üò≠üò≠üò≠
How can it be so hard for someone like me to get my new phone ordered and pay for it in one.
I've often wondered if I could go to the dark side and go iPhone, in all honesty this latest kick in the teeth from Google may just push me over the edge.
I'm utterly utterly disappointed and not sure what I'm going to do next as I cannot stand to live with this pathetic pixel 5 any longer
üò°üò°"
42 "Pretty funny, still using the original, pixel XL. Want to finally update to 6, just can't finish the checkout."
43 "You soured me to your brand with two defective pixel 3XLs and poor customer service. I am having a really hard time talking myself into trusting the name again."
44 "This is a big pile of b******* I had to f****** phone on my cart and it keep telling me I couldn't pay for it and then all of a sudden it goes out of stock what kind of s*** is this"
45 "Wasted a hour and a half of my life trying to refresh your store! It's been in my cart the whole time but wouldn't let me check out!!!!! Now it's out of stock?? Are you kidding me???????"
46 "Google, a ü§¨ huge company, spying on everything that moves, and get servers for their ü§¨ pixel launch to have decent experience. What a ü§¨ joke they are!"
47 "Got to checkout then my pixel pro was removed from cart due to being ""out of stock"". So lame."
48 "Store crashed still can't checkout."
49 "Look like the scalpers won again."
50 "Dear Google please keep Google translate off of my facebook page I speak English and don't need to have it translated into a different language"
51 "There was a problem with the battery on the pixel 4. They were supposedly going to replace it for free but when I went to the I fix it place they didn't know anything about it so I paid a 100 to have my battery replaced"
52 "Umm if I can‚Äôt change fonts on Android 12, I‚Äôm not going with this. Certain fonts let you read faster.. Bring back serif fonts!"
53 "I really want to love my new Pixel 6 but it will go back to the dealer tomorrow, I'll stick to my Pixel 4. No face unlock, no ""mobile"" this thing is huge, and not even the Pro!? The fingerprint sensor failed already on me many times, and i only got the phone for like 7 hours... i really want to like it, but its just not as good as expected."
54 "when will you have the ear buds back in stock, I want to order a 6Pro but want the free ear buds."
55 "an hour of trying and still the site has crashed. again........"
56 "One of the worst customer experiences I have had in awhile. Ordered an older phone and got a delivery date. This date kept moving to the right and I called them to tell them that I needed the phone by a certain date for travel. They promised it would be here a day or two early. Got the shipping confirmation and it is coming the day I leave. No way to cancel the order and they said to deny the delivery when it arrives, which is hard to do when you are out of the country. I was tempted to try Google Fi, but with the way this was dealt with I will stick with what I already have."
57 "not the size no... too big and too heavy"
58 "I took a break from google when they dropped the ball on the battery life on their phones. Now I see they followed trend instead of what worked on their phones. They did not listen to the people that buy their phones and use them. No power brick and then guilt us with all the environment talk. Finger print scanner on the front instead of the back where it worked all the time to now on the screen so one cannot buy a phone case that truly protects the phone. Yes the screens will break just like every other phone out there. Ya screwed up again google. Please start listening to us."
59 "2.5 hours later... I was not able to get the 6 Pro but was able to get the 6. Been using google phones since Nexus 5X Been a customer of Google Fi from the start. I tried to get the phone through the Google Fi site but it kept dumping out. So I went to the Google store where I had the same problems. But sort of glad I did. Ya, see for some reason the store valued my trade-in 100 dollars higher than the Google Fi site. After all these years the Fi side of the house wanted to short me??? WTF???"
60 "Lol, good to hold horses and wait for tg deals. Based on p4 experience üòÖ"
61 "Does RCS work yet? Is there integration with iMessage so I don‚Äôt get microscopic shared videos in group texts?"
62 "When should I expect my refund since my order was cancelled?"
63 "Hi Google, is Pixel 6 eventually be available in Singapore ? I know we are not the first 8 countries to pre book."
64 "Would be nice if they even said something about it but nope Google cant be trusted to communicate."
65 "If the 6 is better than the 4, then it must be worth every penny ü§£üëçüëç . I LOVE my Pixel 4a! Thanks, Google!"
66 "Just got thru to checkout. After 3hrs, pixel 6 pro is mine."
67 "Literally applied for financing on this figuring it was going to be faster, just play the refresh game for 45 minutes and find out they're sold out. Talk about irritating."
68 "I was trying to order. Hope the store gets fixed soon."
69 "Wait is back for me. Was in my cart, now sold out. Any time frame for back in stock? 512 gb black pro."
70 "Yeah, I'm watching the Live Launch event. I absolutely love it. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
71 "And as a complete shocker to all your missing phones, ebay seems to have soooooo many new ones üòÇ"

74 "*Finger print scanner doesn't work with screen protector

The only thing I don't like about this phone is the placement of the finger print scanner.

Having it on the back was so convenient, and not disruptive my user experience, and it ALWAYS WORKED.

The scanner as apart of the screen looks cool, but isn't as practical. I can't even put a screen protector on my new phone because if I did the scanner won't work.

Please start providing screen protectors (that will work) with the phone, just go back the way things were. Nice and simple"
75 "Was trying to get this and google needed me to sign in on my Verizon account but verizon locked me out and I'm stuck"
76 "Yup error on checkout..."
77 "Terrible launch. Bad ordering experience, there was more talk than actual content during the keynote, very limited embargos. üö©üö©üö©üö©üö©üö©üö© Think I might finally switch."
78 "I wish this was sold in PH... so many pixel fans here... Google"

85 "You guys already out of stock for the storm black pixel 6 pro in 256 gb and 512 gb"
86 "Now it's all sold out except the 128 gm model. what a mess"
87 "I think you could've done better on the colors but overall it looks like a pretty sweet phone."
88 "Speaking of oopsies. Because of the issues with the storefront, my order was billed to PayPal instead of Google's financing option. Google's solution is for me to give up my order for the 6 Pro 512gb, and place a new order for the out of stock phone..."
89 "Make it available in HK please"
90 "That doesn't change that I'ma be your next fav Producer follow my page ‚ù§Ô∏è"
91 "Finally able to order my mother's pixel 6 but it won't let me order my pixel pro keep getting error OR-SOFF-01"
92 "Hey Google, why can't I get through to anyone in Google store support? It's been 3 days trying to talk to a customer service agent"
93 "Is Google going to release a statement about the botched release of these new phones? What's happening is leaving a lot of people with unnecessary worries about if they're going to get the new phone they've been waiting for.
I know I am while I type this on my Pixel 2!"
94 "I tried to buy this phone and now my life is ruined."
95 "Can't checkout. I don't recall Apple having similar issues when they launch stuff!"
96 "What an embarrassing launch.
I still think the phone will be great though."
97 "I came here, just to plead to Google, to please end the onslaught that is the Google Fi commercials. They are horrible. I hate them. Please stop this."
98 "I need help in accessing the money my videos have earned and need to speak to a human in google!"
99 "Coming from Pixel 2 I've tried the Pixel 5, 5a, and 6, and have noticed that with all three of these latest phones, the display is a huge step DOWN from the pixel 2. The 5, 5a, and 6, all give me eye strain almost immediately. There is a slight blur to the image -\-\ text and lines are not as sharp as on the Pixel 2. Colors do not pop as well as on Pixel 2. Viewing angles are horrible compared to Pixel 2. What is going on here? I've read about other people experiencing these same issues - particularly the eye strain. This is unacceptable."
100 "Will the Pixel 6 line get unlimited high-quality backup with Google Photos??"
101 "I would pre order to get the free pixel buds but the pixel buds are out of stock now? Do we just lose out on that now?"
102 "Thanks Google. Put what I wanted in my cart. Your checkout crashed, and by the time it was fixed, it was all out of stock. Seriously? Google. You own all the data farms on earth.. and your store was over loaded? How is that even possible?"
103 "Have you fixed the hardware issues from the Google Pixel 4 XL? I have my second one of those that is now having issues again in just over a year. Can you send me one of these free for the troubles I have been having?"
104 "But............
Not in Singapore. Again. Sorry but I'm gonna jump ship now. My 3XL already dead here."
105 "I'm waiting till you lift the embargo and we can see some independent reviews."
106 "I swear ordering this phone has been hell. Your customer service has been a nightmare. By the way thanks for trying to charge my credit card twice. Once for the pre order and again during while releasing it for shipment. The three way call with my credit card company was nice with your support team. Who do you guys hire for customer service?"
107 "I was able to order one on the 20th with the Pixel buds pre-order bonus and a case, but the delivery estimate is weeks apart on each item. Buds next week, case mid November, Phone Dec. 1. Is there a way to get everything in just one package with the phone? I really don't care about the pixel buds to be honest and obviously don't need the case without the phone"
108 "Got one a pro through Verizon no problem"
109 "after continuously clicking trying to buy for an hour and a half, not it says my item is out of stock and has been removed from my cart.. are you kidding me???"

121 "You locked me out of my Google account and my term papers are in there. Please for the love of God help me get back in. I've tried everything. What Google God did I make mad for this to happen to me."
122 "I was going to pre order too but then I was like I think I'm going to wait till they get all the bugs out first"
123 "Did any real people actually get one? All sold out now, the wait continues"
124 "Please launch the phone in Singapore too."
125 "Speaking about Pixel y6 is okay. What happened to Google showing Diwali icon? Very disappointed."
126 "How do you contact customer service for Google pixel phone issues?"
127 "When will the Google phone available officially in Malaysia ~ ?"
128 "Only black if you want more storage??"
129 "Hey Tucker your wireless charging still work on your Pixel 4??"
130 "I‚Äôm waiting for the camera and the performace of new tensor chip testing üòô"
131 "7 days ago, when my cell phone died, Google Fi Support said that my phone was covered under the protection plan and that a replacement phone would be sent to me.

As of today Google Fi Support told me:
- A device was sent to me, delivered, then sent back to the warehouse. (NOTE: I did not receive the replacement phone so I'm not sure why a device would be sent back.)
- An order was placed to replace the initial replacement phone that never made it into my hands.
- Google Support reported internally that I had the replacement device (I NEVER got the replacement device), so the order for the 2nd replacement device was canceled.

My case, for reasons unknown to me, had to be taken care of by a special support team and it takes 24 hours to get a reply.

Nearly everything requires verification nowadays and that typically is done through a code sent to a cell phone. For instance, I can't get into my online checking account unless I am able to receive a verification code via text through my phone. I can physically go to the bank, but I really don't have time for that‚Äîespecially
since not having a phone has essentially created other tasks for my life.

Some businesses only enable customers to manage their accounts through an app on their phone. For instance, I can't cancel upcoming gym classes or change the method of payment unless I can access the app. Again, I can go in person and manage these things, but I don't have time.

I had always thought that I could live without my phone if it came down to it. It didn't seem like a big deal to have to run to the bank or to the gym to handle my business, but life isn't built for that anymore. Having access to a cell phone is mandatory for handling the pace of modern life.

Living without a phone is having a huge impact on being able to manage the logistics of my life, affecting my ability to do my job, costing me money, and affecting my mental health.

Please help me."

Why don't you do a compact design for people who love small smartphones like me"
243 "This looks wonderful. Could you make a smaller one with the same new, great camera? These new phones are far too large to put in one's pocket. It'd be ideal if you had one the same size as the Pixel 3a."

261 "#HeyGoogle love your products but your customer service sucks! Looking at upgrading my Pixel 3XL but your customer service and Google One customer services is making Apple look good, and that says something for someone who loves his Pixel phone. Contacted them on October 22nd and have been bounced around like a ball between agents through email with no one able to solve my Payment profiles issue."

272 "Hi Google

Thought I would bring this to your attention. Scammers are abusing your platform to send out scam texts. I think you need to address this as so far there have been 3 sent to me. All 3 I have traced back to your platform. All three have been scam texts. The scammers are doing something called caller id spoofing replacing the number they are texting from with an australian number. The link in the text is what I trace and all 3 ip addresses are traced back to your platform."

I thought I was making a good decision buying a pixel phone. I was wrong.
It is frustrating.üò°"

Even as a Google Fi customer for years, I've recently had multiple help support tickets open for weeks now and nobody is working on them. As of now I do not recommend their Fi service, and be careful about buying from their store as well. That's where my issue began. #googlepixel #GoogleFi"

You delayed my shipment 5 times already and your customer services team is hopeless and can‚Äôt help

280 "Awful lot of false advertising with these phones. You lied about the max charging speed, you lied about the performance, and lied about the battery life. I smell a class action lawsuit brewing, and I'm not the only one. A quick look at the Pixel subreddit and you'll see a LOT of people are talking about starting one."

283 "I purchased two Pros in black on pre-order, received one, but y'all took my money for two. 8hrs of trying to get in touch with customer service with two reps hanging up on me after saying hello. Now I'm in the second week and 3rd email of confirming my address. Like come on you made Google earth and I've checked, the image sent by the courier who delivered the single phone (in a box physically unable to fit two like label said) looks a lot like the one on Google earth. The $10 voucher for my patience is a laughable as well. I am just looking for some actual answers like we have you in line for the next available or here's a discount or the option to get my money back. Good luck to those in the same situation as I."

286 "Pre ordered within hours of launch. EDD 24 January! Phone that was shown in stock still hasn't shipped! Done with Google after 3 pixles. Their customer service is absolutely garbage!"
287 "Except the phones are not connecting with the cell phone companies networks. And if they do, they constantly lose connection and can't be used in any manner. Is there going to be a fix for this? Otherwise the phone is completely useless as it doesn't make or receive calls, make or receive texts or anything else"

I posted this enhancement of a missing person photo to Youtube where a missing person case is discussed (video title: WMAQ NBC 5 Chicago Signoff (1991) Channel 5 WMAQ-TV Off Air Flag Raising Missing Person). My comment is being shadowbanned (it looks like posted but you reload page and it's deleted). When I try to repost, it also deletes my 2 previous comments!!! I feel anger and disgust towards Google. Because I think this Google censorship starting to be seriously harmful for the society. I cannot post the image here because Google banned posting images and if I post a link on Fakeblock, Fakeblock censors it. I feel anger and disgust towards Fakeblock. So you won't see the enhanced photo unless you send me a message so that I can send it to you personally."

314 "Google has announced they will begin requiring two factor authentication,
password, plus a texted authentication code. I see this as a bad thing for anyone who doesn't have a cell phone, as they'll lose access to their account. A lot of poor people have prepaid accounts, and intermittent lapses in service because they have problems affording to pre-pay. I'm hoping they will offer an alternative authentication method that doesn't require an additional device, either that, or make the two factor thing optional, as other services do. Many homeless around here have email at the library as their only means of electronic communication. Social services, employers, potential employers, others, even Social Security communicate via email, and with only 4 days notice, there's no way these people will be able to set up an alternative email and notify everyone. The very poor don't need an additional kick in the teeth by Google."

318 "Two weeks ago, I got my new Pixel 4a phone. I was blown away by the camera - the main reason why I bought it. But, unfortunately, I dropped my phone from a not too high height about 50 centimeters from the ground. It had a phone case and a screen cover. But, the phone screen cracked from the inside and now I no more have a phone that works. I am so disappointed at Google for charging almost $350 for a phone this fragile. This is to say, I highly advice you to not purchase a google phone."
319 "Hi everyone! I just got my Pixel 6 Pro and one thing I noticed is that the camera turns to a 2mp vga camera during video chats on facebook messenger, whatsapp, and instagram. Although it was awesome when we tried it on google meet video chat. So I was wondering if other people do experience the same thing because I do video chats so often and it's a major turn off for me honestly. I was reading on reddit that a few people have been reporting that issue as well so I wanted to get insights on other social media platforms too."

343 "Once again, Google and others suppressing conservative speech! From WND... Dear friend of WND,

After all the devastating attacks Big Tech has unleashed on WND ‚Äì Google massively suppressing our traffic with its search algorithm, YouTube de-monetizing our channel, Facebook confining WND to ‚ÄúFacebook jail‚Äù and so on ‚Äì you might wonder what else the Big Tech oligarchs could possibly do to hurt us even more?

Well, the grand prize goes to Google, which informed WND this past week that it intends to completely de-monetize the influential 25-year-old Christian conservative news site. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be disabling ad serving on the site wnd.com in 4 business days, on 11/01/21,‚Äù Google has informed us.

That, explains our advertising team, would cut our online ad revenue ‚Äì the largest component of WND‚Äôs income ‚Äì roughly in half, since not only would all Google ads be gone, but many of the ads from alternate ad services as well, since they almost all utilize Google Ad Manager to serve their ads. (Google, we‚Äôre told, is to online advertising what the interstate highway system is to road travel; it‚Äôs really hard to travel serious distances without using them.)

According to Google‚Äôs ‚ÄúViolation Explanation,‚Äù it seems your favorite news site is loaded with ‚Äúdangerous or derogatory content,‚Äù as well as ‚Äúmisrepresentat
ive content‚Äù and ‚Äúunreliable and harmful claims.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe do not allow content,‚Äù explain the Google overlords, ‚Äúthat incites hatred against, promotes discrimination of, or disparages an individual or group on the basis of their race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, age, nationality, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or other characteristic that is associated with systemic discrimination or marginalization
.‚Äù Or which ‚Äúharasses, intimidates, or bullies an individual or group of individuals.‚Äù

Translation: Dare to report honestly on the insane transgender agenda ‚Äì where boys in dresses raping teenage girls in school restrooms is ignored by the school board, where ‚Äúbiological men‚Äù can compete in and destroy women‚Äôs athletics, and where a man who identifies as a woman becomes ‚Äúthe first female 4-star admiral in history‚Äù ‚Äì and you‚Äôre ‚Äúinciting hatred‚Äù and ‚Äúpromoting discrimination.
‚Äù

And what about WND‚Äôs supposedly ‚Äúunreliable and harmful claims‚Äù? Google tells us it does ‚Äúnot allow content that makes claims that are demonstrably false and could significantly undermine participation or trust in an electoral or democratic process. [Or which] promotes harmful health claims, or relates to a current, major health crisis and contradicts authoritative scientific consensus.‚Äù

Translation: Reporting truthfully and accurately on the Biden administration‚Äô
s insane mismanagement of the COVID pandemic ‚Äì from imposing vaccine mandates that are shutting down the country right now, to suppressing early outpatient treatment of COVID with inexpensive, proven-safe-and
-effective medications that could have prevented hundreds of thousands of COVID deaths in America, to pretending ‚Äúnatural immunity‚Äù isn‚Äôt real even though 92 studies prove it‚Äôs superior to vaccine immunity ‚Äì is not allowed. Only the official narrative ‚Äì you know, the one that‚Äôs killing America ‚Äì is allowed.

Ironically, a key component of WND‚Äôs ‚Äúdangerous, derogatory, unreliable and harmful‚Äù content (in Google‚Äôs eyes) has to do with comments posted by WND‚Äôs loyal readers. So, for example, if a reader posts his or her personal views in WND‚Äôs commenting section, and if what they express goes against the woke, Marxist ideology of the internet‚Äôs gatekeepers, then WND is held responsible. Got that? This is obviously idiotic, since an enraged, drooling, leftwing, pajama-clad activist living in his mother‚Äôs basement could easily fill WND‚Äôs commenting section with outrageous statements intended to get us de-monetized by Google! You can‚Äôt make this stuff up.

Unfortunately, it‚Äôs all too real, which is why we have temporarily suspended all commenting on WND stories while we give our tech team the time to figure out how to bring back WND commenting without triggering Google‚Äôs delicate and tyrannical woke sensibilities. To be clear: Once we bring commenting back online, we will not be censoring comments (unless of course they‚Äôre pornographic, obscene, openly racist, promoting violence, etc.), but rather, we‚Äôre working on a technological fix that will allow us to restore commenting while also allowing WND to continue to exist ‚Äì and to report boldly and truthfully, as we have for 25 years!

Of course, Google also says it is triggered by our regular published news content, particularly these three big topics: ‚ÄúCOVID misinformation,
‚Äù allegations of voter fraud, and the transgender issue.

For the record, WND will not cease, nor slow down in any way, from reporting honestly and boldly on these issues. We cannot betray our very reason for existing as a news organization ‚Äì reporting on the crucial developments that matter most to our readers, and which are currently ripping our country apart and destroying the next generation ‚Äì and doing it with courage, accuracy and professionalism
, and with a Christian spirit."

January...It also seemed as if all the carriers, case and screen protector companies were left out on all pre order details until the last minute (which now doesn't matter since the devices are delayed). This was a botched launch and terrible for the everyday customer. If you didn't have so many reviewers on this so called TeamPixel and give them all phones to review, you might have actually had some phones left for paying customers.

I called my bank to see if the problem was on their end, they stated no. I then called google support to see what the issue was and was told that this was a big problem when ordering a pixel 6. Apparently, orders for the 6 were being canceled by the system. So I asked what I needed to do to get my order processed and was told that I needed to reorder from the site. I was fine with that, but the $99.00 earbuds are no longer available and I cant receive the promotion because I did not order within the promotion period. To my chagrin, I lost out on 100 bucks because google made a mistake. This seems mighty unfair and has left a sour note with me. I hope this is not happening to others."

I have had pixel and even nexus phones for so long, but this has left a bad, really bad experience. You are GOOGLE, how could you be this unprepared!?!?

There seems to be an issue online but Google has locked the thread. I called Samsung since I am within my 1-year warranty and they made me go to a store to have it looked at. The tech support at the store could not figure it out. When I called Samsung back to tell them they said they only have a 15-day return policy and could do nothing for me in regards to fixing or replacing the phone. When I called Telus my supplier they will do nothing for me but try to put me on a 2-year plan for a new phone. I always out-right purchase my phones so I am not locked into these contracts. When going to Toyota to the dealership they could not figure out the issue as well and suggested I switch to an Apple Product. When trying to get a hold of Google the threads are turned off and there is no helpline. I am fed up with these large corporations treating the customers horribly. I have owned a Samsung product for over 10 years and this is the first time I've had an issue and I have been severely let down. This is truly sad the amount of money you spend on these products for there to be no help, customer service or replacement options. BUYERS BE WARNED!"

The City of Anaheim denied a Conditional Use Permit for Grandma's House of Hope even though the house was an 8 bedroom, 4500 sq ft house for homeless women suffering from serious and persistent mental illness.

This Is the email from the CEO at GHH:

Blessings Collaborative Members,

I am reaching out for assistance in a very important matter. Grandma‚Äôs House of Hope operates numerous shelter sites in Anaheim to serve vulnerable women with disabilities experiencing trauma of homelessness. We do so in residential neighborhoods coexisting peacefully with the neighbors and providing a home environment to our participants who need a safe space to heal. Whenever we have more than six individuals living in a house, we must apply to the City of Anaheim for a Conditional Use Permit (CUP) and supply information on the proposed project and target population. We have been successful in every application we have submitted in our 17 year history and have ultimately won over even our most skeptical of neighbors.

However, recently we applied for a CUP to operate an 8 bedroom, 4500 sq ft house for homeless women suffering from serious and persistent mental illness who may or may not have developed a substance use disorder as a result. This was the first time we specified a target population of serving those with mental health diagnosis.

Of note: The participants in this program have already been connected to a mental health clinic, diagnosed and given a treatment plan and referred to the OCHCA, who then assesses them for placement in our program. These participants are not required to come into our program and do this of their own free will, expressing their desire to receive services and WANT HELP to change their circumstances.

The neighborhood banded together in a mob-like way during the Planning Commission meeting and spouted the most hateful and discriminatory speech you can imagine. The Planning Commission caved and denied our permit although the staff report had already addressed the issues brought up and found there to be no evidence that there would be an adverse impact on the surrounding neighbors. There was no effort made to ask if any of their concerns could be mitigated and overcome and when I offered to do so, I was shouted into silence by the crowd. The situation was so disturbing that the City Attorney for Anaheim also made a point to caution the commission that denying the permit could be considered as a violation of the Americas with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Housing Accountability Act (HAA).

Needless to say, we are appealing this decision and will be going before the City Council to defend our project on October 26th at 5pm at Anaheim City Hall. Depending on the outcome of that appeal, we plan to evaluate our legal options, should the City Council uphold the Planning Commission‚Äôs decision to deny the CUP. The legal findings that support our cause are detailed in the separate downloadable attachment provided below.

It would mean a great deal to us if you would write a letter of support for Grandma‚Äôs House of Hope. We have drafted a letter that you may use, or you are welcome to express your support in your own words. We would also love to have your support in person if you are able to attend the City Council meeting

You can send your letters via email to njtaylor@anahei
m.net Re: Cup Dev2021-06106
Please cc: jkreitner@grand
mashouseofhope.
org

At the Planning Commission on August 30, we were blindsided by over 85 attendees speaking out against our CUP. They intentionally organized a last minute deluge of protest letters which were submitted after 12 PM on August 30th, our hearing date, and showed up en masse for the first planning commission meeting which was the first in person hearing allowed since the start of the pandemic. The following day, Anaheim announced it would be cancelling all October annual events as a result of the Delta Virus.

This time we hope you will show up as well, and help us exceed their numbers and vocalize our belief that all people, under the Americans with Disabilities Act, should be treated with dignity, equity, and the right to safe housing in Anaheim, The City of Kindness.

Please attend and voice your support for those experiencing homelessness with a mental health disability.

You can attend the October 26th meeting IN PERSON at:

Anaheim City Hall
200 S. Anaheim Blvd.
Anaheim, CA 92805
Please let us know if you have any questions.

With the Google and Google chrome when I search for something it will just load and then tell me that no connection for two weeks
With the playstore, it has stopped opening at all no matter the strength of the network
And also YouTube has also stopped, am only able to view downloaded videos offline.
Will really appreciate any help üôè"

The account was suspended in 2017 because the account was stolen and the account belongs to me and I have all the evidence for that email and password and for the time I created the account, but I do not have the phone number that the hacker put on my account. I hope to respond and solve my problem"

It's pretty awkward for a company touting their cloud program to not anticipate heavy loads and crashing like this.
So finally you've fix things and I go back to checkout but the promotion you had for the earbuds which was in my bag is no longer available because they sold out.... Grrrrr so yes I was able to get the phone on ore order but your mess up screwed me out of the buds! Google I think you need to do some kind of raincheck for your customers!!"

475 "You guys pulled some swine bag moves. Offer people free Pixel Buds with a pre-order Pixel 6...but you need to add it to your cart manually instead of you guys just including it in your pre-order of the phone.

By the time you add the Pixel Buds to your cart...you lose the phone you had in your cart...and then you get no phone and no buds.

For a multi-billion dollar company, the launch of the Pixel 6 was a disaster. Maybe you should rent servers from Apple...that's how a proper launch is done.

And WTF are you doing with the Canada pre orders??? Are you Fu*king serious?

without. After years of waiting and months of excitement, the last hour has been terrible."
505 "Not cool. Finally got the phones I wanted into my cart, then took an hour and 30 minutes trying to check out. Finally, the system emptied my cart saying that the phones I wanted was out of stock. By the time I was able to get back into the pre-order screen, all phones were out of stock."
506 "The wait is nowhere near over. I went to pre-order a 6 Pro within minutes of the launch and got endless errors. I added the phone, buds and protection to my cart to get the bud discount but then when I got to the checkout page I have gotten nothing but errors since. It's coming up on two hours and now my cart shows only two items rather than three but I can't even see what they are. If the phone I have been trying to buy nonstop is now sold out then I'll and up buying an iPhone. Your incompetence in this launch is astounding."

508 "Started at minute one, couldn't add to cart, after 45 minutes I could add to cart, but not checkout, after another hour of that, all the phones I've been trying to buy for almost two hours are ""sold out""...

Time for Google official annual ""Pixel Launch/Ball drop extravaganza""

Absolutely ridiculous for one of the biggest companies in the world to not even be able to handle a standard phone launch.

Google has been screwing these launches up for a freaking DECADE, figure it out!"
