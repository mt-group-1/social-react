686,"That, explains our advertising team, would cut our online ad revenue ‚Äì the largest component of WND‚Äôs income ‚Äì roughly in half, since not only would all Google ads be gone, but many of the ads from alternate ad services as well, since they almost all utilize Google Ad Manager to serve their ads.

693,"And what about WND‚Äôs supposedly ‚Äúunreliable and harmful claims‚Äù?

697,"Ironically, a key component of WND‚Äôs ‚Äúdangerous, derogatory, unreliable and harmful‚Äù content (in Google‚Äôs eyes) has to do with comments posted by WND‚Äôs loyal readers. So, for example, if a reader posts his or her personal views in WND‚Äôs commenting section, and if what they express goes against the woke, Marxist ideology of the internet‚Äôs gatekeepers, then WND is held responsible. Got that? This is obviously idiotic, since an enraged, drooling, leftwing, pajama-clad activist living in his mother‚Äôs basement could easily fill WND‚Äôs commenting section with outrageous statements intended to get us de-monetized by Google! You can‚Äôt make this stuff up.",0
698,"Unfortunately, it‚Äôs all too real, which is why we have temporarily suspended all commenting on WND stories while we give our tech team the time to figure out how to bring back WND commenting without triggering Google‚Äôs delicate and tyrannical woke sensibilities. To be clear: Once we bring commenting back online, we will not be censoring comments (unless of course they‚Äôre pornographic, obscene, openly racist, promoting violence, etc.), but rather, we‚Äôre working on a technological fix that will allow us to restore commenting while also allowing WND to continue to exist ‚Äì and to report boldly and truthfully, as we have for years!",1

The Andriod auto voice to text command doesn't want to work anymore in my Toyota Highlander. There seems to be an issue online but Google has locked the thread. I called Samsung since I am within my -year warranty and they made me go to a store to have it looked at. The tech support at the store could not figure it out. When I called Samsung back to tell them they said they only have a -day return policy and could do nothing for me in regards to fixing or replacing the phone. When I called Telus my supplier they will do nothing for me but try to put me on a -year plan for a new phone. I always out-right purchase my phones so I am not locked into these contracts. When going to Toyota to the dealership they could not figure out the issue as well and suggested I switch to an Apple Product. When trying to get a hold of Google the threads are turned off and there is no helpline. I am fed up with these large corporations treating the customers horribly. I have owned a Samsung product for over years and this is the first time I've had an issue and I have been severely let down.

990,"The City of Anaheim denied a Conditional Use Permit for Grandma's House of Hope even though the house was an bedroom, sq ft house for homeless women suffering from serious and persistent mental illness.",0
991,This Is the email from the CEO at GHH:,N
992,"Blessings Collaborative Members,",1
993,"I am reaching out for assistance in a very important matter. Grandma‚Äôs House of Hope operates numerous shelter sites in Anaheim to serve vulnerable women with disabilities experiencing trauma of homelessness. We do so in residential neighborhoods coexisting peacefully with the neighbors and providing a home environment to our participants who need a safe space to heal. Whenever we have more than six individuals living in a house, we must apply to the City of Anaheim for a Conditional Use Permit (CUP) and supply information on the proposed project and target population. We have been successful in every application we have submitted in our year history and have ultimately won over even our most skeptical of neighbors.",1
994,"However, recently we applied for a CUP to operate an bedroom, sq ft house for homeless women suffering from serious and persistent mental illness who may or may not have developed a substance use disorder as a result. This was the first time we specified a target population of serving those with mental health diagnosis.",0
995,"Of note: The participants in this program have already been connected to a mental health clinic, diagnosed and given a treatment plan and referred to the OCHCA, who then assesses them for placement in our program. These participants are not required to come into our program and do this of their own free will, expressing their desire to receive services and WANT HELP to change their circumstances.",1
996,"The neighborhood banded together in a mob-like way during the Planning Commission meeting and spouted the most hateful and discriminatory speech you can imagine. The Planning Commission caved and denied our permit although the staff report had already addressed the issues brought up and found there to be no evidence that there would be an adverse impact on the surrounding neighbors. There was no effort made to ask if any of their concerns could be mitigated and overcome and when I offered to do so, I was shouted into silence by the crowd. The situation was so disturbing that the City Attorney for Anaheim also made a point to caution the commission that denying the permit could be considered as a violation of the Americas with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Housing Accountability Act (HAA).",0
997,"Needless to say, we are appealing this decision and will be going before the City Council to defend our project on October th at pm at Anaheim City Hall. Depending on the outcome of that appeal, we plan to evaluate our legal options, should the City Council uphold the Planning Commission‚Äôs decision to deny the CUP. The legal findings that support our cause are detailed in the separate downloadable attachment provided below.",1
998,"It would mean a great deal to us if you would write a letter of support for Grandma‚Äôs House of Hope. We have drafted a letter that you may use, or you are welcome to express your support in your own words. We would also love to have your support in person if you are able to attend the City Council meeting",1

They intentionally organized a last minute deluge of protest letters which were submitted after PM on August th, our hearing date, and showed up en masse for the first planning commission meeting which was the first in person hearing allowed since the start of the pandemic. The following day, Anaheim announced it would be cancelling all October annual events as a result of the Delta Virus.",0
