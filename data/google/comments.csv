Ive pretty much dedicated my digital life to Google... Hell I've even endured the pixel 5!!!

How can it be so hard for someone like me to get my new phone ordered and pay for it in one.
I've often wondered if I could go to the dark side and go iPhone, in all honesty this latest kick in the teeth from Google may just push me over the edge.

As of today Google Fi Support told me:
- A device was sent to me, delivered, then sent back to the warehouse. (NOTE: I did not receive the replacement phone so I'm not sure why a device would be sent back.)
- An order was placed to replace the initial replacement phone that never made it into my hands.
- Google Support reported internally that I had the replacement device (I NEVER got the replacement device), so the order for the 2nd replacement device was canceled.

My case, for reasons unknown to me, had to be taken care of by a special support team and it takes 24 hours to get a reply.

Nearly everything requires verification nowadays and that typically is done through a code sent to a cell phone. For instance, I can't get into my online checking account unless I am able to receive a verification code via text through my phone. I can physically go to the bank, but I really don't have time for that‚Äîespecially
since not having a phone has essentially created other tasks for my life.

Some businesses only enable customers to manage their accounts through an app on their phone. For instance, I can't cancel upcoming gym classes or change the method of payment unless I can access the app. Again, I can go in person and manage these things, but I don't have time.

I had always thought that I could live without my phone if it came down to it. It didn't seem like a big deal to have to run to the bank or to the gym to handle my business, but life isn't built for that anymore. Having access to a cell phone is mandatory for handling the pace of modern life.

Living without a phone is having a huge impact on being able to manage the logistics of my life, affecting my ability to do my job, costing me money, and affecting my mental health.

Please help me.",2021-10-26 21:46:39,,[],,,[]

password, plus a texted authentication code. I see this as a bad thing for anyone who doesn't have a cell phone, as they'll lose access to their account.

I'm hoping they will offer an alternative authentication method that doesn't require an additional device, either that, or make the two factor thing optional, as other services do. Many homeless around here have email at the library as their only means of electronic communication. Social services, employers, potential employers, others, even Social Security communicate via email, and with only 4 days notice, there's no way these people will be able to set up an alternative email and notify everyone.

After all the devastating attacks Big Tech has unleashed on WND ‚Äì Google massively suppressing our traffic with its search algorithm, YouTube de-monetizing our channel, Facebook confining WND to ‚ÄúFacebook jail‚Äù and so on ‚Äì you might wonder what else the Big Tech oligarchs could possibly do to hurt us even more?

Well, the grand prize goes to Google, which informed WND this past week that it intends to completely de-monetize the influential 25-year-old Christian conservative news site. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be disabling ad serving on the site wnd.com in 4 business days, on 11/01/21,‚Äù Google has informed us.

That, explains our advertising team, would cut our online ad revenue ‚Äì the largest component of WND‚Äôs income ‚Äì roughly in half, since not only would all Google ads be gone, but many of the ads from alternate ad services as well, since they almost all utilize Google Ad Manager to serve their ads. (Google, we‚Äôre told, is to online advertising what the interstate highway system is to road travel; it‚Äôs really hard to travel serious distances without using them.)

According to Google‚Äôs ‚ÄúViolation Explanation,‚Äù it seems your favorite news site is loaded with ‚Äúdangerous or derogatory content,‚Äù as well as ‚Äúmisrepresentat
ive content‚Äù and ‚Äúunreliable and harmful claims.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe do not allow content,‚Äù explain the Google overlords, ‚Äúthat incites hatred against, promotes discrimination of, or disparages an individual or group on the basis of their race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, age, nationality, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or other characteristic that is associated with systemic discrimination or marginalization
.‚Äù Or which ‚Äúharasses, intimidates, or bullies an individual or group of individuals.‚Äù

Translation: Dare to report honestly on the insane transgender agenda ‚Äì where boys in dresses raping teenage girls in school restrooms is ignored by the school board, where ‚Äúbiological men‚Äù can compete in and destroy women‚Äôs athletics, and where a man who identifies as a woman becomes ‚Äúthe first female 4-star admiral in history‚Äù ‚Äì and you‚Äôre ‚Äúinciting hatred‚Äù and ‚Äúpromoting discrimination.
‚Äù

And what about WND‚Äôs supposedly ‚Äúunreliable and harmful claims‚Äù? Google tells us it does ‚Äúnot allow content that makes claims that are demonstrably false and could significantly undermine participation or trust in an electoral or democratic process. [Or which] promotes harmful health claims, or relates to a current, major health crisis and contradicts authoritative scientific consensus.‚Äù

Translation: Reporting truthfully and accurately on the Biden administration‚Äô
s insane mismanagement of the COVID pandemic ‚Äì from imposing vaccine mandates that are shutting down the country right now, to suppressing early outpatient treatment of COVID with inexpensive, proven-safe-and
-effective medications that could have prevented hundreds of thousands of COVID deaths in America, to pretending ‚Äúnatural immunity‚Äù isn‚Äôt real even though 92 studies prove it‚Äôs superior to vaccine immunity ‚Äì is not allowed. Only the official narrative ‚Äì you know, the one that‚Äôs killing America ‚Äì is allowed.

Ironically, a key component of WND‚Äôs ‚Äúdangerous, derogatory, unreliable and harmful‚Äù content (in Google‚Äôs eyes) has to do with comments posted by WND‚Äôs loyal readers. So, for example, if a reader posts his or her personal views in WND‚Äôs commenting section, and if what they express goes against the woke, Marxist ideology of the internet‚Äôs gatekeepers, then WND is held responsible. Got that? This is obviously idiotic, since an enraged, drooling, leftwing, pajama-clad activist living in his mother‚Äôs basement could easily fill WND‚Äôs commenting section with outrageous statements intended to get us de-monetized by Google! You can‚Äôt make this stuff up.

Unfortunately, it‚Äôs all too real, which is why we have temporarily suspended all commenting on WND stories while we give our tech team the time to figure out how to bring back WND commenting without triggering Google‚Äôs delicate and tyrannical woke sensibilities. To be clear: Once we bring commenting back online, we will not be censoring comments (unless of course they‚Äôre pornographic, obscene, openly racist, promoting violence, etc.), but rather, we‚Äôre working on a technological fix that will allow us to restore commenting while also allowing WND to continue to exist ‚Äì and to report boldly and truthfully, as we have for 25 years!

Of course, Google also says it is triggered by our regular published news content, particularly these three big topics: ‚ÄúCOVID misinformation,
‚Äù allegations of voter fraud, and the transgender issue.

For the record, WND will not cease, nor slow down in any way, from reporting honestly and boldly on these issues. We cannot betray our very reason for existing as a news organization ‚Äì reporting on the crucial developments that matter most to our readers, and which are currently ripping our country apart and destroying the next generation ‚Äì and doing it with courage, accuracy and professionalism

I was fine with that, but the $99.00 earbuds are no longer available and I cant receive the promotion because I did not order within the promotion period.

When I called Samsung back to tell them they said they only have a 15-day return policy and could do nothing for me in regards to fixing or replacing the phone. When I called Telus my supplier they will do nothing for me but try to put me on a 2-year plan for a new phone. I always out-right purchase my phones so I am not locked into these contracts. When going to Toyota to the dealership they could not figure out the issue as well and suggested I switch to an Apple Product.

The City of Anaheim denied a Conditional Use Permit for Grandma's House of Hope even though the house was an 8 bedroom, 4500 sq ft house for homeless women suffering from serious and persistent mental illness.

This Is the email from the CEO at GHH:

Blessings Collaborative Members,

I am reaching out for assistance in a very important matter. Grandma‚Äôs House of Hope operates numerous shelter sites in Anaheim to serve vulnerable women with disabilities experiencing trauma of homelessness. We do so in residential neighborhoods coexisting peacefully with the neighbors and providing a home environment to our participants who need a safe space to heal. Whenever we have more than six individuals living in a house, we must apply to the City of Anaheim for a Conditional Use Permit (CUP) and supply information on the proposed project and target population. We have been successful in every application we have submitted in our 17 year history and have ultimately won over even our most skeptical of neighbors.

However, recently we applied for a CUP to operate an 8 bedroom, 4500 sq ft house for homeless women suffering from serious and persistent mental illness who may or may not have developed a substance use disorder as a result. This was the first time we specified a target population of serving those with mental health diagnosis.

Of note: The participants in this program have already been connected to a mental health clinic, diagnosed and given a treatment plan and referred to the OCHCA, who then assesses them for placement in our program. These participants are not required to come into our program and do this of their own free will, expressing their desire to receive services and WANT HELP to change their circumstances.

The neighborhood banded together in a mob-like way during the Planning Commission meeting and spouted the most hateful and discriminatory speech you can imagine. The Planning Commission caved and denied our permit although the staff report had already addressed the issues brought up and found there to be no evidence that there would be an adverse impact on the surrounding neighbors. There was no effort made to ask if any of their concerns could be mitigated and overcome and when I offered to do so, I was shouted into silence by the crowd. The situation was so disturbing that the City Attorney for Anaheim also made a point to caution the commission that denying the permit could be considered as a violation of the Americas with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Housing Accountability Act (HAA).

Needless to say, we are appealing this decision and will be going before the City Council to defend our project on October 26th at 5pm at Anaheim City Hall. Depending on the outcome of that appeal, we plan to evaluate our legal options, should the City Council uphold the Planning Commission‚Äôs decision to deny the CUP. The legal findings that support our cause are detailed in the separate downloadable attachment provided below.

It would mean a great deal to us if you would write a letter of support for Grandma‚Äôs House of Hope. We have drafted a letter that you may use, or you are welcome to express your support in your own words. We would also love to have your support in person if you are able to attend the City Council meeting

You can send your letters via email to njtaylor@anahei

At the Planning Commission on August 30, we were blindsided by over 85 attendees speaking out against our CUP. They intentionally organized a last minute deluge of protest letters which were submitted after 12 PM on August 30th, our hearing date, and showed up en masse for the first planning commission meeting which was the first in person hearing allowed since the start of the pandemic. The following day, Anaheim announced it would be cancelling all October annual events as a result of the Delta Virus.

This time we hope you will show up as well, and help us exceed their numbers and vocalize our belief that all people, under the Americans with Disabilities Act, should be treated with dignity, equity, and the right to safe housing in Anaheim, The City of Kindness.

Please attend and voice your support for those experiencing homelessness with a mental health disability.

You can attend the October 26th meeting IN PERSON at:

Anaheim City Hall
200 S. Anaheim Blvd.
Anaheim, CA 92805
Please let us know if you have any questions.

Offer people free Pixel Buds with a pre-order Pixel 6...but you need to add it to your cart manually instead of you guys just including it in your pre-order of the phone.

By the time you add the Pixel Buds to your cart...you lose the phone you had in your cart...and then you get no phone and no buds.

For a multi-billion dollar company, the launch of the Pixel 6 was a disaster. Maybe you should rent servers from Apple...that's how a proper launch is done.

And WTF are you doing with the Canada pre orders??? Are you Fu*king serious?
