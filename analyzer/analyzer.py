    then  Processing and organizing data through a set of operations, then  extract the features from the comments


    Then divide the data into training and test data, and then get accuracy using machine learning model.

        Process Done Inside the load_data Function:
        1. read the txt file
        2. process data and clean it 
        3. extract feature in the data and save it
        4. split the data in the train and test 
        5. use a SCV model for tran data and get accurcy
