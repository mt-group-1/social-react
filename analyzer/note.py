# class will handle data processing including 
# *labeling 
# *feature extraction
# *split features to train and test datasets using SKLEARN
# *calculate Accuracy using train and test data usng support vector machine or random forest
# !============================================
# ? Neural Network
# * create a Sequential model 
# * data preparation
# * compile the model
# * Train The Model
# * Testing the model
# * retrieveing score and accuracy
# * validate model accuracy positive, negative score
# * create a funtion to predict given post positive - negative impact
